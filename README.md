# Variable System (VS)
The Variable System (VS) is a program for the analysis of 
conditional path models using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). 
VS is a powerful tool that helps applied researchers, students, 
academic professionals who have some basic knowledge in SEM to 
develop and evaluate a wide range of theoretical models by providing 
1. basic model parameter estimates and their tests,
2. overall model goodness of fit evaluations, and
3. estimates and tests for complex conditional direct and indirect effects.
