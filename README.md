# Variable System (VS)
VS (Variable System) is a free open-source statistical package for the analysis of conditional path models based on structural equation modeling (SEM). It can be used to examine models with simple mediation, simple moderation, moderated mediation (moME), mediated moderation (meMO), and any combinations of them.

VS is easy to use. Users only need to specify the conceptual model using simple control languages in R and the package will automatically
1. transform the conceptual model into a testable SEM-based model,
2. estimate the basic model parameters, 
3. compute and test the conditional effects of interest, 
4. evaluate the model goodness-of-fit.
