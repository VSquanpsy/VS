Description: The Variable System (VS) is an R package for the analysis of 
    conditional path models based on structural equation modeling (SEM). 
    It can be used to examine models with simple mediation, simple moderation, 
    moderated mediation (moME), mediated moderation (meMO), and any combinations 
    of them. Users only need to specify the conceptual model and VS will 
    automatically 
    (1) transform the conceptual model in a testable SEM-based model,
    (2) estimate the basic model parameters, 
    (3) compute and test the conditional effects of interest, and
    (4) evaluate the model goodness-of-fit.
